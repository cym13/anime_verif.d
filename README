Description
===========

This simple script allows one to check the consistency of a set of files. It
was designed to check sets of videos but can be used for other kind of files
as well (at least for the moment).

Features
========

Anime_verif checks the deviation of sizes within a directory and the
consistency of numeration (if there is a 2 there should be a 1 and so on).

It generates the list of anomalies and it is up to you to check them
manually. That was done because it generates a LOT of false positive because
of different encodings or bonus episodes.

Usage
=====

Check size anomalies and episode numbers sequence.

Usage: anime_verif [-a N] [-s|-n] DIRECTORY

Options:
    -h, --help          Print this help and exit
    -a, --accuracy N    Do not show files whose size deviation is less than N
                        times the standart deviation. Default is 3.
    -s, --size          Check size only
    -n, --numbers       Check episode numbers only

If -s and -n are missing or if -s and -n are used together, size and numbers
are both checked.


Dependencies
